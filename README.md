## Bozana's Spring Integration Patterns examples

* This is my collection of examples which illustrate usage of spring integration patterns
* All examples are for illustration purpose only. The intention was to make them as simple as possible, and if possible to be base them on HelloWorld example. (Again, they illustrate how to use spring integration patterns, not to write hello world in java).
